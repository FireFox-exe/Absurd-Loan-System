#  Loan Roast System

An unapologetically sarcastic loan analysis system built with Flask.  
You give us your age, income, criminal record and payment history,  
and we give you either approval or a passive-aggressive life lesson.

## How to Run:

A web app that helps users check loan eligibility with absurd honesty.

##  Project Overview

This project analyzes loan eligibility based on the following inputs:

- Age
- Monthly Income
- Criminal Record (and release date)
- Payment Status (and last payment date)

Each input triggers a tailored response -â€” ranging from polite denial to digital shade.

##  Idea & Inspiration

This project was 99% custom-built based on a concept by me (https://github.com/FireFox-exe), and implemented with a little help from ChatGPTâ€™s twisted sense of humor(A.K.A The Comedian).

No tutorials, no templates â€” just good old logic and creativity. *Find a bug? or any redundancy, feel free to let me know or change it personally.*

##  Features

-  Dynamic status messages (Approved, Pending, Denied)
-  Responses with actual personality
-  Smart conditional logic
- ðŸ‘€ Ready to scale into APIs, databases, or automation bots
