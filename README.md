#  Loan Roast System

An unapologetically sarcastic loan analysis system built with Flask.  
You give us your age, income, criminal record and payment history,  
and we give you either approval or a passive-aggressive life lesson.

---

##  Project Overview

This project analyzes loan eligibility based on the following inputs:

- Age
- Monthly Income
- Criminal Record (and release date)
- Payment Status (and last payment date)

Each input triggers a tailored response -â€” ranging from polite denial to digital shade.

- **Flask**
- **HTML (Jinja2 templates)**
